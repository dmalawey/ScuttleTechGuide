This page is an archive of "guides" and "miniguides" from the scuttle organization.  They are created in pptx format and published as PDF files.

As of 2025, we are moving towards rebuilding the content so that all elements are accessible at the source level.

## Guides

* [3D Printing guide](https://github.com/dmalawey/ScuttleTechGuide/blob/8229d4248907da1a00189591b9e0524b9b4737cb/docs/SCTL_3DPrintingGuide.pdf)
  * Best practices for printing with our selected equipment, ABS filaments, samples of our printing settings, and common issues with resolutions.
* [Battery guide](https://github.com/dmalawey/ScuttleTechGuide/blob/8229d4248907da1a00189591b9e0524b9b4737cb/docs/SCTL_BatteryGuide.pdf)
  * Indicates the changes in battery design from version 1 to version 3, details about wiring the battery module, the battery management system (BMS) circuit, and shows assembly steps for the battery with graphics and renderings.
* [Bill of Materials](https://github.com/dmalawey/ScuttleTechGuide/blob/347e7ed26e132915fd544da7abf47246ee838cad/docs/SCTL_BillofMaterials.pdf)
  * A past-published bill of materials, for standard components of the SCUTTLE robot.  Includes a list of 3d printed parts with filenames and descriptions. 
* [Brochure Version 3.0](https://github.com/dmalawey/ScuttleTechGuide/blob/87159519749f1c26796e31aba2aa04de925d15d9/docs/SCTL_Brochure_V3.pdf)
  * Description of key upgrades from version 2 to version 3 of the SCUTTLE robot design.  Includes renderings of the 3D models, describes issues from version 2.0 that were resolved, and higlights changes in individual parts and subassemblies.  This guide can indicate for a user of SCUTTLE version 2.0 which parts are still compatible with the version 3.0 chassis, wheels, encoders, and electronics brackets.   
* [Community guide](https://github.com/dmalawey/ScuttleTechGuide/blob/8229d4248907da1a00189591b9e0524b9b4737cb/docs/SCTL_CommunityGuide.pdf)
  * breaks down the elements (electrical, mechanical, software, firmware) accessible to the open community and how the elements fit together for the robot design.  Information on where we publish digital assets like CAD models, software version, etc.  High-level information about the vision for the community, and the relationships between private enterprises, student learners, universities, and professional engineers who are weekend hackers. 
* [Contributor guide](https://github.com/dmalawey/ScuttleTechGuide/blob/8229d4248907da1a00189591b9e0524b9b4737cb/docs/SCTL_ContributorGuide.pdf)
  * Precise steps and thinking processes for engineers who wish to contribute improvements to the community.  Includes (some, but not all) best-practices for publishing CAD models, shopping for desirable off-the-shelf (OTS) parts, and selecting actuators or sensors for design of new modules, to best fit together with our body of publications.
* [Designer Guide](https://github.com/dmalawey/ScuttleTechGuide/blob/f548e63118579fbc95579865da31575e4b750d71/docs/SCTL_DesignerGuide.pdf)
  * Has some redundancy with the Contributor guide.  This PDF needs cleanup and topics should be more clearly segmented between design, contribution, communicating in the community, and upgrading designs of other designers.
* [IoT Guide](https://github.com/dmalawey/ScuttleTechGuide/blob/68b96d1abf113f4788b408c9ff95eca8e614704d/docs/SCTL_IotGuide.pdf)
  * Shows our recommended background information for learning IoT (internet of things).  Offers an early dated architecture for naming topics in MQTT, for fleets of scuttle robots and other connected edge-devices to interact autonomously.  Suggested parameters on the robots to publish as a template set of diagnostics information or status for maintenance, charging, and robot activity.
* [Kinematics Guide](https://github.com/dmalawey/ScuttleTechGuide/blob/c8e50dc6ebf7e51be8d5fc9b00a747eeffef6401/docs/SCTL_KinematicsGuide.pdf)
  *  Background knowledge for the mathematics involved in computing the robot positions and movements.  Offers variable names for standard functions like wheel odometry, PID speed control, and computation of curves and displacements in the navigation of the robots.  Uses established mathematics and cites sources for the study & development of robotic navigation.  Indicates parameters and variables that map to the physical robot geometry such as wheelbase, wheel diameter, heading, etc.
