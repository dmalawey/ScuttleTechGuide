## Logos
Download these logos as needed to refer to scuttle robotics in your documents or slides.  It is OK to use our brand when you are referring to SCUTTLE Robotics organiztion but it is not ok to impersonate our organization or pretend that your publication was authored by us.  Pretty simple!

### Preferred Logo
Preferred means it's the most commonly used as of right now (they get adjusted sometimes, mainly by filetype, background, pixel count) and right now this one is the most usable.  JPG is in general the smallest file type for a simple colored logo, whereas some of the png files have a clear background and are best for powerpoints with colored backgrounds.

### Logo Packet
Download this zip file to grab the set of logos with various backgrounds and sizes, including ico filetype for icons.  However, we mostly use .png filetype even for icons since 2024, because it became more accepted by docsify-this, wordpress, etc.

## Copyright
Brief explanation of copyright to follow.  All copyrighted content is managed in a way that is reasonable, fair, and (I think) helpful for students or creators who want to use our content.  You won't have any trouble unless you are causing trouble.

**Essence of Copyright**
Copying is a situaton of taking credit for others' work, but good engineering is when you utilize other work to create your own new outcome.  There is no conflict between these, so use your good judgement and aim for fair use! If you reproduce any item from SCUTTLE content, then it should be clear in your work what portion is your own creation and what is your creation.  If you make a class presentation, take our graphics to tell _about_ SCUTTLE content and do not _pretend to be_ the organization.

The purpose of branding is simply so users can discover the organization that initiated our designs, to find the community, discover our standards, contribute to a unified direction, and so forth.  Our name and our logo are just cues to inform people of where the content came from.  We have reserved rights to make a robot and call it SCUTTLE, sell it for profit, and build integrity in a brand that has many  but you can make anything that is "Built on a SCUTTLE platform."  We simply registered a copyright so that the name SCUTTLE refers to our organization's publications.

If you make improvements and addons, we want you to include "SCUTTLE" or "SCUTTLE Robot" in your online post so the community can find works like yours that expand possibilities for creations we offer, and include your name or your organization to credit yourself.

**For individuals:**
We WANT you to copy, that's why we publish our work.  Copy our designs, and if you make an improvement, please share it! If it's a major improvement, we want it added to the collection of open designs so please get connected through discord or otherwise.

**Small Businesses:**
Build on our designs, and credit our work. If you collect revenue by pretending to be the SCUTTLE organization, this is bad.  If you implement our designs in your own designs and profit, that's great!  If it's unclear, then reach out and connect. The intended nature of our intellectual property is no different than other creations in the world.
