# Computing

This section covers the various computer options for your SCUTTLE CPU. We integrated these different computing options in partnership with some of the board developers, to help get users started in any direction they want.

| CPU choice | Key Advantage                       | Users |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ----- |
|  Pi        | popular computer                    | students & resesarchers       |
| BeagleY-AI | for advanced robotics developers    | advanced mechatronics         |
| TI Edge AI SK | AI computing and generous IO     | autonomous driving developers |
| Intel      | industrial controller               | industry & manufacturing      |

## Pi_4

**Raspberry Pi 4B with Broadcom ARM processor**
This is the latest model of raspberry pi as of 2025 with the pi version 3B the most popular unit on our robots right now.  Design-wise the integration is the same for version 3 and 4, except that Pi 4 uses USB-C for power input.

## Beagle
**BeagleY-AI, released 2024 March**

Beaglebone blue was actually the first ever board we integrated on SCUTTLE, with scuttle version 1 in the classroom for Mobile Robotics at Texas A&M in 2018.  From there we adopted raspberry pi to gain the most popular 40-pin i/o format the world's developers were getting very familiar with. As of 2024, we regrouped with Beagle to get their latest board set up on SCUTTLE.  The new AI device features Texas Instruments chips and an affordable, high performance compact board with a form factor like Pi.
