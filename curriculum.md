SCUTTLE was designed in parallel to a university engineering curriculum.  At Texas A&M, students in the Mobile Robotics course perform weekly labs and learn one module each week with a hands-on activity.  Get access to the university lessons here and perform a self-study to become a robotics engineer.

## Labs
The labs for Mobile Robotics were designed mostly by David Malawey up to 2019.  Future changes have been made for these labs but the core knowledge remains unchanged.  The curriculum is a key part of a Mechatronics Engineering program and we have also included the set of prerequisites for the course & lab below.  Reviewing these prerequisites can show the necessary background for a student to gain the full benefit of studying in this course.
