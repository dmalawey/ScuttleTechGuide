SCUTTLE was designed in parallel to a university engineering curriculum.  At Texas A&M, students in the Mobile Robotics course perform weekly labs and learn one module each week with a hands-on activity.  Get access to the university lessons here and perform a self-study to become a robotics engineer.

## Labs
The labs for Mobile Robotics were designed mostly by David Malawey up to 2019.  Future changes have been made for these labs but the core knowledge remains unchanged.

## Project
The semester concludes with a 4-week team project.  By week 9 or 10, the students have a grasp of every module and the software to operate the robot.  Below, find slides that outline a project as a template made in powerpoint.
