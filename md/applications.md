*This page is intended to serve the same function as the SCUTTLE [Applications Guide](https://www.scuttlerobot.org/resource/guide/applications-guide/) (in PDF) but to become more dynamic, open, and easily navigable.

# Section 1: Hardware-focused Applications

Robotic projects, listed by their application, which focus a project on a mechanical design.

## Example 1.17 Pole-mounted Maintenance

**Discussion of problem:**
* Tasks that require a broomstick are often tedious, located in narrow spaces, or requiring frequent repetition.  The fact that we have attached an item to a broomstick indicates right away that the human arm is not sufficient to do a job easily. 

**Discussion of solution:**
* Achieve painting, cleaning, or other maintenance functions with your SCUTTLE by attaching any off-the-shelf tool that uses the standard ACME (broomstick) thread.

**Why it's easy**

## Example 1.18 Ship Painter

**Discussion of problem:**
* The most expensive part of a ship is the maintenance, which relies on continuous painting to prevent corrosion
* Every crew member of a ship is costly, so docking the ships may be required to dock for painting.
* Discovery of rust & deteriorated paint may be more important than applying paint.
* It is tedious to search a whole ship for rust so currently there is no affordable solution.
* Remote communication is unreliable on the sea, so remote expertise cannot help very much with identifying rust, etc.

**Discussion of solution:**
* A robot painter could make continuous scanning for rust, 24 hours per day, reducing docking time for the ship.
* The robot painter can utilize edge AI to take photos and evaluate paint
* While automation is still expensive, only high-cost problems are feasible and this is a high-cost problem.
* Solar energy is highly available, making continuous recharge of the robot feasible
