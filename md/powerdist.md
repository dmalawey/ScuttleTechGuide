1. Use a simple DIN bracket to secure a terminal.  Drill out the center hole to 4mm.
2. Use an M2.5x12mm screw and M2.5 heat-set insert.
3. If you have a deburring tool, deburr your hole for a cleaner insertion.
4. Insert the thead to a flush position.
5. use a zip tie to secure the cable.
6. We recommend the terminal pair for the power source is secured and the load pair is free.
7. secure your source wires into the power distribution terminals and the DIN bracket onto your rail.
Now your power source is ready for quick plugging!
