## Manuals
You can learn a great deal from reading these manuals - not only how to use a tool, but better techniques, compatible materials, safety wisdom, and available mods that you didn't know existed.

We customize many of our manuals (modified pdfs) for the following goals:
* reduced file size
* improved readability & accessibility
* add notes as needed
* make manuals easier to distribute online
* digitize manuals that were previously paper-only

**This is a placeholder to begin posting tools manuals.**
