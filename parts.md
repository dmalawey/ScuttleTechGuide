## OTS
Off-the-shelf parts make up the key technologies onboard the robot.  They're made from world-class technology companies and highly refined manufacturers.

## Prints

Printed parts are the custom designs that hold your robot together.  In the SCUTTLE design, there are about 15 standard prints and hundreds of community-made addons.
