## OTS
Off-the-shelf parts make up the key technologies onboard the robot.  They're made from world-class technology companies and highly refined manufacturers.

## Prints

Printed parts are the custom designs that hold your robot together.  In the SCUTTLE design, there are about 15 standard prints and hundreds of community-made addons.

Here's a photo with all the prints for SCUTTLE version 3.0 in one box.  Some of the prints shown are preassembled with their mating parts, as found in the kit product.

The i2c bracket snaps onto the DIN rail and secures the i2c circuit board.  The motor driver bracket snaps onto the DIN rail and holds the motor driver.  Self tapping screws are used for both brackets.
* ![din parts1](img/prints_din1.jpg)

Each wheel assembly has five parts (wheel bracket, wheel pulley, wheel spacer, and motor pulley, encoder bracket).  The wheel bracket (big print) has a unique print for left and right, but the remaining parts are identical left-to-right.  This means you'll find 6 total .STL files for these 5 parts.  See the first photo with fresh prints and the second photo with one drivetrain assembly built.

The camera assembly features 3 prints.  The "bracket" holds the camera, the "pivot" joins both parts, and the "twist bracket" clips into the chassis aluminum rails.  This assembly holds the only M5 sized fastener, with 20mm length and nested nut feature in the print.

The battery assembly has two prints.  The "panel" carries a power switch and two pairs of anderson terminals.  The "din bracket" clips onto the DIN rail with an embedded spring clip.  The parts join with superglue but they are aligned using a screw, M2.5x10.

Two identical prints called pi bracket hold the pi in place.  The pi bracket grips the DIN rail on one edge and snaps-down on the other edge (left and right as shown in the photo).  Brass heat-set inserts are fitted into the prints and M2.5 machine screws secure down the raspberry pi.  Assembly: mount the brackets to the DIN, line up the pi using the holes, and add the four screws.  To remove the pi, keep the bracket attached.  Lift the tabs which bend, and release the bracket from the DIN rail. It's recommended to keep these brackets attached to your pi to protects the bottom facing features from shorting on a tabletop.  The pi fits best in the direction shown, with lifter tabs exposed.

The kickstand attaches by-hand without hardware.  The design features compliance to snap onto the aluminum rail, and the kickstand lifts the wheels off the ground.  Test your drivetrain right at your desk without your SCUTTLE running off!  Alternatively, lift your robot 90 degrees to store it on the kickstand, taking less space.  The designed height suits the standard robot clearance and you can adjust this model to modify as needed.

The DIN bracket attaches a DIN rail to the chassis, with two identical copies per robot.  Features on this design: tabs interlock with the aluminum, so you can first mount these without screws.  Loosely fit the M6 screw and dropin nut to hold the DIN rail while allowing repositioning.  Finally, tighten the M6 screw to lock in the position.

The battery din-bracket features a pocket that accepts a spring clip, and the spring clip locks this bracket on DIN rail (but you can still nudge it to slide it).  After printing, the supports are removed and the clip is installed.  In the photo below, find the left-hand bracket as-printed and the right-hand bracket installed on the DIN rail.
* ![battery bracket with DIN spring](img/prints_din3.jpg)

The encoder bracket has two copies on the robot, for the left and right encoders. It features two holes for M2.5 machine screws to attach to the wheel assembly.  Two more holes accept the tiny M2 screws for either left-hand or right-hand mounting of the encoders.  The configurations are shown in the photo.

Don't overtighten the shaft bolt!  Grip the narrow end of the tool to achieve proper hand-torque.

# 3D Printing

---
Printing Info
1. We always use ABS filament for the best toughness.  You can build the robot with any material but the design is for ABS.
2. Standard SCUTTLE v3.0 requires about 330g of 3D printed parts.  Everything is designed for manufacturing in FFF with no supports.
3. Direction: Each design is exported with a coordinate system called "PRINT" to give the STL a default upright direction. To help identify the orientation, our labels are debossed for reading upright during printing, and the default text location is 6mm up from the base with 6mm font.  Then you can catch an issue early in the printing of a new part.
4. Designs are made for typical out-of-box print settings, such as 30% infill and two exterior layers.  The nozzle is 0.4mm and path width 0.45 or 0.5mm.
5. Designs aim for anyone to print.  Instead of dialing in super-fine print settings, we build geometry that tolerates a common low-cost printer performance.
6. Most of our parts feature a built-in design lesson.  The kickstand is a great example for compliance.  The wheel bracket carefully integrates print direction with stress direction.
7. The version numbers are independent for each part.  If we improve a design for one part, we release that design so you can upgrade individual pieces.
