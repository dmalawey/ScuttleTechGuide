# Power Budget
A dedicated section for budgeting power. This contains details the power system onboard SCUTTLE.  With extensibility as a central goal for SCUTTLE, we aim to offer sufficient detail to let you engineer any new function or actuator you can dream of.  The data below shows the power demand when averaging the devices onboard the robot, with their expected duty cycles and power levels.  We made individual measurements of the devices - the raspberry pi uses the most power at around 4 watts on average.

## DIN Power

Quick guide steps to route power with DIN rail.

1. Use a simple DIN bracket to secure a terminal.  Drill out the center hole to 4mm.
2. Use an M2.5x12mm screw and M2.5 heat-set insert.
3. If you have a deburring tool, deburr your hole for a cleaner insertion.
4. Insert the thead to a flush position.
5. use a zip tie to secure the cable.
6. We recommend the terminal pair for the power source is secured and the load pair is free.
7. secure your source wires into the power distribution terminals and the DIN bracket onto your rail.
Now your power source is ready for quick plugging!

## Efficiency
The mobile robot is designed for efficiency at carrying loads and SCUTTLE specifically was designed with energy consumption in mind.  Note when compared to a typical quadrotor drone, the robot has more runtime, less mass, and higher payload by immense factors.
