By 2025 we have produced a solid number of sensor models that are popular in the maker community, commonly used in robotics, and recommended for integrating to pursue your robotics mission. As of December 2025 I will begin a library of models that have a clean CAD setup, accuratley matching real parts, and have been tested together with SCUTTLE electronics.

**Current & Power**
INA219 is a highly popular selection for DC current measurement & it reports over i2c.  We validated this sensor with the SCUTTLE motor driver, and it can attach to the dual-motor-driver power input terminals to indicate the total battery energy passing to the motors (or back, during recharge)
