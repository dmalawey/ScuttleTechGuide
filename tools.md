Tools for SCUTTLE Robot learning & development

## Build

The tools to build a SCUTTLE Robot from our kit are incredibly simple.  We engineered version 3.0 down to the individual fasteners for assembling the robot with minimal tools.

## Manuals

_The info below will be relocated to OpenLab, along with lots more._

>
> Please find the "Tools Guide" published as a PDF in archives tab, until we can unpack the main tools on this page.

You can learn a great deal from reading these manuals - not only how to use a tool, but better techniques, compatible materials, safety wisdom, and available mods that you didn't know existed.

We customize many of our manuals (modified pdfs) for the following goals:
* reduced file size
* improved readability & accessibility
* add notes as needed
* make manuals easier to distribute online
* digitize manuals that were previously paper-only

**This is a placeholder to begin posting tools manuals.**
